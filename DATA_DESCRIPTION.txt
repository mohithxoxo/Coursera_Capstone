DATA DESCRIPTION

For this problem, we will get the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of two cities, in terms of their neighborhoods. 
The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, 
theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Manhattan
from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use machine learning technique, “Clustering” to segment the neighborhoods
with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot 
traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate the tourist’s areas and hubs, and then we 
can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis.
